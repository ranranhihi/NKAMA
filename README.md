# Non-uniform Kriging-assisted Metaheuristic Algorithm (NKAMA)
- This is the MATLAB code of the NKAMA proposed in the unpublished paper “A Surrogate-assisted Metaheuristic Algorithm Framework for Expensive Black-box Optimization Problems”.
- NKAMA is implemented on the platform PlatEMO [1].
- The Kriging model of NKAMA is implemented using the SURROGATES toolbox [2].
